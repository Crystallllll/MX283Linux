NAME
    BusyBox - The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux

SYNTAX
     busybox <applet> [arguments...]  # or

     <applet> [arguments...]          # if symlinked

DESCRIPTION
    BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a
    single small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of
    the utilities you usually find in GNU coreutils, util-linux, etc. The
    utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than their
    full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
    provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
    counterparts.

    BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in
    mind. It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude
    commands (or features) at compile time. This makes it easy to customize
    your embedded systems. To create a working system, just add /dev, /etc,
    and a Linux kernel. BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment
    for any small or embedded system.

    BusyBox is extremely configurable. This allows you to include only the
    components you need, thereby reducing binary size. Run 'make config' or
    'make menuconfig' to select the functionality that you wish to enable.
    Then run 'make' to compile BusyBox using your configuration.

    After the compile has finished, you should use 'make install' to install
    BusyBox. This will install the 'bin/busybox' binary, in the target
    directory specified by CONFIG_PREFIX. CONFIG_PREFIX can be set when
    configuring BusyBox, or you can specify an alternative location at
    install time (i.e., with a command line like 'make
    CONFIG_PREFIX=/tmp/foo install'). If you enabled any applet installation
    scheme (either as symlinks or hardlinks), these will also be installed
    in the location pointed to by CONFIG_PREFIX.

USAGE
    BusyBox is a multi-call binary. A multi-call binary is an executable
    program that performs the same job as more than one utility program.
    That means there is just a single BusyBox binary, but that single binary
    acts like a large number of utilities. This allows BusyBox to be smaller
    since all the built-in utility programs (we call them applets) can share
    code for many common operations.

    You can also invoke BusyBox by issuing a command as an argument on the
    command line. For example, entering

            /bin/busybox ls

    will also cause BusyBox to behave as 'ls'.

    Of course, adding '/bin/busybox' into every command would be painful. So
    most people will invoke BusyBox using links to the BusyBox binary.

    For example, entering

            ln -s /bin/busybox ls
            ./ls

    will cause BusyBox to behave as 'ls' (if the 'ls' command has been
    compiled into BusyBox). Generally speaking, you should never need to
    make all these links yourself, as the BusyBox build system will do this
    for you when you run the 'make install' command.

    If you invoke BusyBox with no arguments, it will provide you with a list
    of the applets that have been compiled into your BusyBox binary.

COMMON OPTIONS
    Most BusyBox applets support the --help argument to provide a terse
    runtime description of their behavior. If the
    CONFIG_FEATURE_VERBOSE_USAGE option has been enabled, more detailed
    usage information will also be available.

                ARG1 & ARG2     ARG1 if neither argument is null or 0, otherwise 0
                ARG1 < ARG2     1 if ARG1 is less than ARG2, else 0. Similarly:
                ARG1 <= ARG2

                ARG1 != ARG2
                ARG1 >= ARG2
                ARG1 > ARG2
                ARG1 + ARG2     Sum of ARG1 and ARG2. Similarly:
                ARG1 - ARG2
                ARG1 * ARG2
                ARG1 / ARG2

                length STRING           Length of STRING
                quote TOKEN             Interpret TOKEN as a string, even if
                                        it is a keyword like 'match' or an
                                        operator like '/'
                (EXPRESSION)            Value of EXPRESSION

        Beware that many operators need to be escaped or quoted for shells.
        Comparisons are arithmetic if both ARGs are numbers, else
        lexicographical. Pattern matches return the string matched between
        \( and \) or null; if \( and \) are not used, they return the number
        of characters matched or 0.

    makedevs
        makedevs [-d device_table] rootdir

        Create a range of special files as specified in a device table.
        Device table entries take the form of:

        <name> <type> <mode> <uid> <gid> <major> <minor> <start> <inc>
        <count> Where name is the file name, type can be one of: f Regular
        file d Directory c Character device b Block device p Fifo (named
        pipe) uid is the user id for the target file, gid is the group id
        for the target file. The rest of the entries (major, minor, etc)
        apply to to device special files. A '-' may be used for blank
        entries.

    mdev
        mdev [-s]

        mdev -s is to be run during boot to scan /sys and populate /dev.

        Bare mdev is a kernel hotplug helper. To activate it: echo
        /sbin/mdev >/proc/sys/kernel/hotplug

        It uses /etc/mdev.conf with lines [-][ENV=regex;]...DEVNAME UID:GID
        PERM [>|=PATH]|[!] [@|$|*PROG] where DEVNAME is device name regex,
        @major,minor[-minor2], or environment variable regex. A common use
        of the latter is to load modules for hotplugged devices:

                $MODALIAS=.* 0:0 660 @modprobe "$MODALIAS"

        If /dev/mdev.seq file exists, mdev will wait for its value to match
        $SEQNUM variable. This prevents plug/unplug races. To activate this
        feature, create empty /dev/mdev.seq at boot.

        If /dev/mdev.log file exists, debug log will be appended to it.

LIBC NSS
    GNU Libc (glibc) uses the Name Service Switch (NSS) to configure the
    behavior of the C library for the local environment, and to configure
    how it reads system data, such as passwords and group information. This
    is implemented using an /etc/nsswitch.conf configuration file, and using
    one or more of the /lib/libnss_* libraries. BusyBox tries to avoid using
    any libc calls that make use of NSS. Some applets however, such as login
    and su, will use libc functions that require NSS.

    If you enable CONFIG_USE_BB_PWD_GRP, BusyBox will use internal functions
    to directly access the /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow files
    without using NSS. This may allow you to run your system without the
    need for installing any of the NSS configuration files and libraries.

    When used with glibc, the BusyBox 'networking' applets will similarly
    require that you install at least some of the glibc NSS stuff (in
    particular, /etc/nsswitch.conf, /lib/libnss_dns*, /lib/libnss_files*,
    and /lib/libresolv*).

    Shameless Plug: As an alternative, one could use a C library such as
    uClibc. In addition to making your system significantly smaller, uClibc
    does not require the use of any NSS support files or libraries.
